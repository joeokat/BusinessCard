        <p> 
          Three of my students made ¢2,500 each this month by developing a simple web application
           and the truth is, digital products are very easy to build. It's just most people just don’t have the right ideas. <br />
          So I made a FULL GUIDE teaching you how to make ¢2,000/m+ in my course.
